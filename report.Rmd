#Predicting Weight-lifting Activity Class
First, we load the data. The data has been previously downloaded into the working directory
using download.data.R.
  
```{r}
library(lattice); library(ggplot2); library(caret)
train <- read.csv('training.csv', na.strings = c('NA', ''))
NAcol <- sapply(train, anyNA)
train2 <- train[,!NAcol]
class <- train$classe
train3 <- train2[,-c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,60)]
```
The data is loaded and columns with missing data are excluded. These are summary columns, and 
we will be predicting based on single rows (which we need to do for the test set). The class of each
row is then copied into a seperate variable. The columns for timestamp, name, and window are removed.
The outcome, classe, is also removed.
```{r}
nearZeroVar(train3, saveMetrics = TRUE)
```
None of the remaining predictors have near zero variance.
